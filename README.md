### Implemented and Working Properly

Base Tetris project forked and cloned locally<br>
got familiar with .md files<br>
changed poml.xml file to use java version 21 instead of 23<br>
Project compiles successfully with Java 21<br>
Maven + JavaFX environment correctly set up<br>
Game window launches<br>
Bricks spawn, fall, and render<br>
Controllers load without errors<br>

### Implemented but Not Working Properly

(Will update as development continues)

### Features Not Implemented

(Will list non-implemented assignment features as work progresses)

### New Java Classes

(None added yet — will update when created)

### Modified Java Classes

No functional modifications yet

### Unexpected Problems

JavaFX + Maven setup required fixing compiler target compatibility

Java path / JAVA_HOME configuration issues resolved

Fullscreen mode causes layout stretching (expected, to be fixed later)
